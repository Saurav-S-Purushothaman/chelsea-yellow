# Chelsea Yellow #

This Emacs theme, Chelsea Yellow, is a monochrome for programmers who
prefer a clean and focused coding environment. Inspired by the calming
warmth of the color Chelsea Yellow, this theme strips away unnecessary
colors, allowing your attention to stay sharp on the code itself. The
code is inspired from
[grey-paper-theme](https://melpa.org/#/grey-paper-theme)

# Installation #

Download the theme to your local directory. You can do it through `git
clone` command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Saurav-S-Purushothaman/chelsea-yellow
```

Then add path to chelsea-yellow-theme to custom-theme-load-path list â€”
add the following to your emacs config file somewhere (.emacs,
init.el, whatever):

```
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path
             "/path/to/chelsea-yellow-theme/")
```

Use `M-x customize-themes` to change your current theme.

# Contribution #

Chelsea yellow is a monochrome theme made up of just 6 color. But it
has a lack of support for any emacs mode. Feel free to add appropriate
color faces (see file chelsea-yellow-theme.el) and send me a pull
request. This help is much appreciated.

Thanks.
